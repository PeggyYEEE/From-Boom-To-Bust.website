                                <a>Over the last three years, China's real estate sector has encountered an unprecedented crisis. Even major players such as Evergrande, a leading industry figure, have been mired in mounting debt and defaults, contradicting the long-standing notion that they are too big to fail.


                                    <br><br>
                                    An unfinished building crisis and loan protests erupted in the summer of 2022. We saw the overall sales plummet by an astounding 50% while the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to haunt developers in China's real estate industry, sending shivers down their spines.

                                    <br><br>
                                    What tales lie behind the figures? Has the real estate industry's heyday passed, or is a revival imminent?


                                    <br><br>
                                    Let's dive into the data to gain deeper insights into the sector's evolution over the past decades and see what the future holds.

                        In 2011, the Beijing government relaxed restrictions on developers and investors to support growth in the housing sector, which was a significant contributor to the country's overall economic expansion.


                        <br><br>

                        The policies aimed to boost private investment in the real estate market, and they included the reduction of the minimum registered capital required for real estate development companies to RMB $1 million (USD $150,000), making it easier for small- and medium-sized developers to enter the market. Previously, developers needed a minimum registered capital of RMB $10 million (USD $1.5 million).

                                Li, a 49-year-old former construction worker, it was an opportune time for many small developers to start their businesses. "I worked in a state-backed company; at that time, many colleagues left to join privately held companies, and they all received high pay," said Li.

                                <br><br>

                                Soon after, Li left the company and became an engineering project supervisor, overseeing projects in Xiamen, Beijing, Wuhan, and Changsha.


                                <br><br>

                                The resulting surge in property sales increased by 19.4% in 2012 compared to 2011, setting the stage for continued expansion in the sector. Real estate became the most important pillar of the world's second-biggest economy as sales grew at an average rate of 9% from 2013 to 2017. 


                                <br><br>

                                While these policy changes helped boost the economy, they also contributed to rising property prices, leading to concerns about housing affordability.

                                In 2018, the Chinese government shifted its approach and implemented measures to prevent a property bubble from forming and to avoid potential financial risks. 


                                <br><br>

                                By 2020, the sector had grown into the largest sector, accounting for approximately 6% of the country's GDP according to official data, though some analysts argued that it was far larger. 

                                <br><br>

                                Strong demand for housing and other real estate-related services, government policies supporting the sector, and the linkages between the property market and other sectors of the economy drove this growth.


                                <br><br>
                                The regulatory clampdown focused on several areas, including tighter lending policies, higher down payment requirements, and ownership caps on properties for individuals.

                                    Targeting speculators, Beijing required banks to raise the minimum down payment for buyers of second homes from 50% to 60% and for buyers of third homes and above to pay a down payment of at least 80%.

                                    "With the current structural changes, Chinese consumers not only bought one property because the benefits of buying and holding properties were high and there was a speculative atmosphere," said Wilfred Sit, Chief Investment Officer, Hang Seng Investment Management.

                                    The policy allowed residents to own a maximum of two residential properties in the city, with certain exceptions for people who relocated for work or study.

                                    Critics said the crackdown on the property market was too hasty and lacked measures to regulate it. "They attempted to do in two years what should have taken ten years to accomplish," said Li.

                                    The COVID-19 pandemic devastated China's housing market in early 2020, as lockdowns in major cities such as Wuhan and Hubei Province disrupted sales. The impracticality of visiting properties and relocating led to a 39.9% drop in national sales of residential buildings in the first two months of the year. 

                                    <br><br>

                                    Property sales dropped by over 80% in Wuhan, where strict lockdown measures were imposed, and where the pandemic was first detected.

                                    “The pandemic did not have a significant impact on my income, but it was a challenging period for new brokers who had just entered the industry,” said Huang, a senior property agent with 15 years of experience in Wuhan, noting that there was a noticeable reduction in employment in the agency sector.


                                    <br><br>

                                    “Many of them could not continue in the industry afterward,” Huang stated. "It is a necessary process to weed out the inferior performers and enhance the quality of services," he added.


                                    <br><br>

                                    The market gradually recovered later in the year, with total property sales in 2020 reaching $17.5tn yuan (USD $2.7tn), a negligible 0.1% decline from the previous year, according to official data. However, Huang stated that the trade volume remained low in the past three years, and the virus outbreak merely expedited the industry's restructuring.




                                    <br><br>

                                    At the outset of 2022, sales did not return to pre-pandemic levels even in the first-tier cities. 

                                    <br><br>

                                    New home sales in Shanghai in the first quarter of 2022 demonstrated a 10% decrease, and market confidence remained fragile, casting a shadow over the entire 2022 sales volume, which decreased by 10%, marking the first decrease in recent years.



                                    <br><br>

                                    “Covid eroded consumer confidence, and during the economic downturn, people are still very cautious when it comes to buying or investing in properties,” said Li.

                    The property sector is grappling with a debt crisis, with even major players struggling to secure financing. In 2021, Evergrande, one of the leading developers, was downgraded due to its inability to meet financial obligations and repay loans on time. 

                    <br><br>

                    This has raised fears about the far-reaching consequences for the Chinese economy and the global financial system.


                    <br><br>
                    Fantasia Holdings Group, faces a debt crisis with a total debt exceeding $7 billion as of September 2021. Its troubles began in late 2020 when it was unable to repay some loans on time, leading Moody's to downgrade its rating from B2 to Caa1, citing "persistent liquidity stress."

                    <br><br>
                    "Leverage, when it works for you, it's very good, but when it's not working for you, the contraction can also be very, very painful and sharp," said Dong Chen, the head of Asia Macro Research at Pictet.

                        Fantasia's shares have plummeted in recent months, with its stock falling by more than 30% in a single day in August 2021 after it announced that it had failed to secure new financing. The company is currently in talks with potential investors and creditors to raise funds and restructure its debt.
    
    
                        <br><br>
                        The debt issue has exposed the tip of the iceberg, with concerns spreading about the potential risk of a bubble explosion. Smaller developers are bearing the brunt of the crisis, with Yuzhou Properties, a Guangzhou-based developer, seeing its shares plummet by more than 70% last year due to concerns about its ability to meet debt obligations.

    
                        <br><br>
                        Seazen Holdings, based in Shanghai, has also faced financial difficulties and has been forced to sell off assets to raise cash. Both companies have been hit hard by the government's efforts to cool the property market and rein in debt. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to weather the storm.
    
                        <br><br>
    
                        In early 2021, a court in Hainan province officially declared HNA Group bankrupt. This marked one of the largest and most high-profile corporate failures in China in recent years and highlighted the challenges faced by many Chinese companies that had expanded rapidly through debt financing.
    
                        <br><br>
    
                        As listed property firms are also feeling the squeeze, China Fortune Land Development's outstanding debt and interest payments that were not repaid on schedule reached RMB $101.304 bn (USD $15.7 bn) by the end of 2021.
    
                        <br><br>
    
                        During the summer of 2022, Sunshine 100 (02608) reported that all outstanding principal of its 2022 bonds, as well as all accrued but unpaid interest, had matured on June 29th. Due to adverse factors such as the macroeconomic downturn and the decline in the real estate market, Sunshine 100 was unable to repay, resulting in a default on its debt.
    
                        <br><br>
                        At the time of the announcement, the total outstanding principal of the 2022 bonds was USD $219.6 million, with accrued but unpaid interest of approximately USD $28.47 million. It was previously announced that the company had delayed the publication of its full-year financial results for 2022 until March 31, 2023.
                        <br><br>
    
                        "It's becoming increasingly apparent that some of these developers will not survive. They expanded too aggressively and accumulated too much debt, and they will be punished. Many of them are already feeling the consequences," said Chen.

                    "Stop construction, stop loans, deliver houses, repay loans!"



                    <br><br>
                    On July 20, 2022, approximately 200 homeowners rallied in front of the regulatory office in Hubei, shouting slogans and protesting against a property development by Greenfield Holding with a state-backed assets background, which had become an unfinished building.


                    <br><br>

                    Running out of cash, a direct consequence of developers facing liquidity challenges is a clear sign of incomplete buildings.
                    <br><br>
                    Loan suspension crises have erupted in various parts of China, and unfinished buildings have become the focal point of the Chinese internet and forums, with people protesting against developers who delay delivery.

                    <br><br>
                    This long-standing problem was reignited in the summer of 2022 by homebuyers who refused to pay their loans. Nationwide protests emerged, raising concerns about the stability of the housing market and the broader financial system.

                    <br><br>
                    People who posted their protest videos on the internet claimed that they had "no other options".

                    <br><br>
                    The owners of the Evergrande development in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, stated that they would not pay if the building could not be completed, and this event spread widely on the internet. According to volunteers' data collected as of October 2022, 344 unfinished buildings had occurred in 119 cities.

                            The cost of not repaying loans is significant due to the credit system. Failing to repay loans on time may result in the debtor being blacklisted and unable to use public transportation.


                            <br><br>

                            Failing to repay loans can have severe consequences beyond being blacklisted from public transportation. Non-payment can negatively impact the debtor's credit score, hampering their ability to obtain future financing and potentially leading to legal action or property seizure by the lender.
                            <br><br>

                            In China, a pre-sale system for property development has become popular among buyers and developers. Under this system, buyers can reserve a property before it hits the open market by making a deposit, securing funding for developers before construction has even begun.

                            <br><br>

                            The pre-sale system has become the root of the issue. If developers face financial difficulties or mismanage funds, buyers who have already made payments may be left with an incomplete building. In some cases, developers have even disappeared with buyers' money, leaving them with no legal recourse.
                            <br><br>

                            Property buyers criticize banks for not effectively supervising developers and ensuring that projects are completed on time and to an acceptable standard.
                            <br><br>

                            The banks' practice of lending money to developers with a history of leaving projects unfinished has enabled them to continue leveraging without facing any consequences, adding to the buyers' concerns.

                            <br><br>
                            Protestors emphasized the role that banks play in the pre-sale system and highlighted the need for more rigorous regulation and oversight to prevent future occurrences of unfinished buildings.
                            <br><br>
                            "Thirty percent of banks have problems with ongoing cases of unfinished buildings, with a total amount of $3 trillion yuan, equivalent to 3% of China's GDP. This affects the confidence of other collateral markets," stated Ms. Daisy Li, China Equity Fund Manager of EFG Asset Management.

                            <br><br>
                            Despite the crisis, Li believes that it would not cause the entire bubble to burst. However, it does pose significant risks within the sector and its connection with banks.
                            <br><br>

                            "This issue is very different from the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. At that time, people did not have the funds or ability to repay their debts, but with unfinished buildings, the problem is that people are unwilling to repay their debts even though they can," Li said.

                            In China, the sale of land usage rights is a crucial source of local government income, heavily relied upon for generating revenue through national land transfer fees. Typically, these fees contribute to over 25% of the total income of local governments.


                            <br><br>

                            In recent years, local governments have become increasingly dependent on these sales as tax revenue is consumed by stimulus measures.
                            <br><br>

                            In 2020, the sale of land usage rights amounted to approximately $8,414.2 billion yuan (USD $1.3 trillion), which was more than 44% of total local government income, marking the highest level in recent years.

                            Despite weak property market sentiment in 2021, the sales increased by 3.46%, and the level remained high, equivalent to tax revenue, underscoring their importance as a significant source of local government income.
                            <br><br>
                            In 2022, a drastic 23% decline in aggregate sales of land usage rights was observed as debt-stricken private developers stepped back, home sales declined, and Beijing tightened credit. 
                            <br><br>
                            As a result, the amount dropped to $6,685.4 billion yuan (USD $1.03 trillion), accounting for 36% of the total income. Moreover, the local government's selling of land decreased by 10% compared to 2021, marking the most substantial decline in fiscal revenue in decades.

                            LGFVs are typically established as independent legal entities with their credit ratings, allowing them to borrow money at lower interest rates than the local government would be able to if it borrowed directly and are expected to get the repayment of the bonds backed by the future revenue streams generated by the projects.

                                Local governments are subject to borrowing restrictions set by the central government to prevent excessive borrowing and maintain overall financial stability.

                                To work around these restrictions, LGFVs are often seen as having implicit government support, which can make them an attractive investment option for investors seeking relatively safe fixed-income securities.

                                Zunyi Daoqiao, the biggest LGFV in Guizhou, announced on December 31, 2022, that it has finalized a restructuring plan for its $15.594 billion yuan (USD 2.46 billion ) bank loan.


                            </div>

                                style="color: #f0f3f5; text-align: left; margin-right: 15px;">
                                The move is aimed at addressing the firm's debt burden, which has been a concern for investors and regulators alike. Under the plan, the loan will be extended for a period of 20 years, with no interest payments due for the first 10 years.

                            </div>
                            <br><br>

                                style="color: #f0f3f5; text-align: left; margin-right: 15px;">
                                The issue is particularly acute in Zunyi City, where land sales transactions plunged by approximately 19% in the first half of 2022, compared to the preceding year.

                                style="color: #f0f3f5; text-align: left; margin-right: 15px;">
                                The dip in revenue presents a challenging scenario for LGFVs, which rely heavily on land sales proceeds to service their interest-bearing debt obligations.

                                “The nature of LGFV is largely oriented towards public policy, and its cash flow at the company level is generally weaker," said Cindy Yang, the Vice President of Moody's.

                                Companies below the provincial capital level in the northwest, northeast, or southwest regions are facing challenges in issuing bonds and are being burdened with higher risk premiums.

                                LGFVs operating in economically deprived areas are at a higher risk of defaulting on their debt obligations“In certain regions, this proportion exceeds 50%, indicating that the corresponding debt financing risk is relatively high,” she added.

                        As property developers continue to struggle with debt and bankruptcy, there are concerns about the amount of bad debt that banks have on their books.


                        <br><br>
                        Recent data from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission shows that the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for China's banking sector increased from 1.6% at the end of 2020 to 1.8% at the end of June 2021. 



                        <br><br>
                        While this may seem like a small increase, it represents a significant amount of bad debt in absolute terms, with total NPLs exceeding $2 trillion yuan (USD $310 billion).
                        <br><br>
                        NPLs are considered bad debts due to the minimal chances of recovering defaulted loan repayments. The rise in NPLs poses a great risk for the Chinese banking sector, potentially leading to decreased profitability and increased risk for investors and account holders. 


                        <br><br>
                        As the banks entered 2023, most of them recorded an increase in the NPL ratio, with weaker financing compared to 2022. 

                        <br><br>
                        According to data collected from 32 listed Chinese banks, although mega banks like Postal Savings Bank of China and Bank of Communications seem to remain well-collateralized, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of China both recorded NPLs above 5%, which is higher than the healthy range of 3%.

                        <br><br>
                        The polarization of the banking sector has intensified, with weaker and more aggressive banks facing higher risks. "Banks with aggressive risk appetite and high geographic concentration could be left with inner buffers and add more risk for these types of smaller banks," said Ming Tan, Lead Analyst at S&P.

                        <br><br>
                        Located in Henan Province and Liaoning, respectively, Zhongyuan Bank and Jinzhou Bank, two local Chinese banks, have reported NPL ratios significantly above the healthy range. Zhongyuan Bank recorded an NPL ratio of 9.38%, while Jinzhou Bank's NPL ratio stood at 10.37%. 

                        <br><br>
                        The figures paint a bleak picture, indicating a substantial risk of bank failure in these regions, which could potentially have severe consequences for both the financial institutions and the local economy at large.

                        Yu-Rong Pi,48, a Wuhan property owner, has witnessed her property appreciate significantly over the past decade, from $1.3 million yuan to $3 million yuan (USD $465,517). Despite its value rising to $3.5 million yuan before the pandemic, Pi has opted not to sell, believing that there is no longer room for appreciation.

                        In contrast, Sunny Wong, 50, a freelancer living in Hangzhou, is currently seeking a new property due to the city's purchase restrictions.

                        <br><br>

                        Sunny Wong, a freelancer living in Hangzhou, decided to look for a new
                        property because her son has turned 18.

                        <br><br>
                        "The current price increase is not significant," Wong said. "I waited for my son to turn age 18 to look for a new purchase for retirement. The overall trend is for stable prices."




                        <br><br>
                        Senior real estate agent, Huang, echoes Wong's sentiments, stating that the market is shifting towards real living demands and that prices will not return to 2018 levels.


                        <br><br>
                        In Wuhan, sales prices began declining after 2018 due to an inventory of new homes and government incentives to clear vacant properties.


                        <br><br>

                        "Currently, we advise sellers to sell when it's time because prices won't rise like before, and the overall trend is for stable prices," said Huang.

                        According to the Chinese Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, there are approximately 600 million buildings in urban and rural areas, as well as over 800,000 municipal facilities in China.





                        <br><br>

                        Cities with significant population inflows continue to experience substantial housing demand, while many small and medium-sized cities and towns may experience a continuous rise in vacancy rates.

                        <br><br>
                        Notably, Guangdong province, which includes the first-tier cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, has the lowest per capita residential building area of around 29.59 square meters and per household area of 72.06 square meters among all provinces and cities, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 

                        <br><br>

                        Shanghai's per capita and household living area ranks second to last at 30.58 square meters and 73.86 square meters, respectively, while Beijing's figures rank third to last at 33.41 square meters and 77.64 square meters.
                        <br><br>
                        "In first-tier cities, there is still demand for housing, but in third- and fourth-tier cities, housing prices have fallen severely. Some citizens living in Heilongjiang described it as 'even if the government gave it to you for free, no one would want to live there'," said a real estate expert. 

                        <br><br>
                        As such, the gap between third- and fourth-tier, and first-tier cities in terms of pricing and vacancy is expected to widen further.

                            Seven of the top ten developers in China are state-backed enterprises as of the end of 2022. This new ranking highlights the ascendancy of state-backed enterprises over private rivals. 

                            <br><br>
                            For instance, Poly Group, China's leading developer, weathered the storm better than its competitors, with a contract sales volume of RMB $457 billion (USD $70.43 billion) in 2022, a decrease of under 15%. 

                            <br><br>

                            In contrast, the second-ranked developer, Vanke Group, experienced a 34% slump in sales.



                            <br><br>

                            "The strong players are now state-backed enterprises such as Poly, China Overseas, and China Merchants Shekou," stated Li. "Private enterprises are being suppressed, and it is difficult for them to acquire land."




                            <br><br>

                            The situation was particularly acute for the top ten developers, with Sunac China experiencing a 72% decline in sales, Shimao a 68% decline, and Seazon a 50% decline in contract sales volume compared to 2021.


                            <br><br>
                            Even traditionally strong private developers have not been immune to the market downturn. 


                            <br><br>
                            For instance, China's leading private developer, Country Garden Holdings, posted its first loss in 15 years in 2022, reflecting the challenging operating environment in its annual result announcement.

                            <br><br>
                            "The real estate industry is now walking on thin ice," warned Li. "Private enterprises are collapsing, but the government won't let you go bankrupt. It's like living dead, only keeping a few people there to continue operating."


                            <br><br>
                            Longfor Group's sales declined by 31% throughout 2022, but compared to other private enterprises, their performance remained stable.
                            <br><br>
                            "We see a clear long-term opportunity in the land market, as the industry undergoes consolidation and reshaping. With fewer competitors in land acquisition, investors have become more rational, and even the government has become more rational," said Zhao, Longfor's Chief Financial Officer, at the company press conference.

                            <br><br>
                            In 2020, China Evergrande Group, which ranked second, ceased disclosing its monthly sales figures. After defaulting on a $750 million offshore bond in 2021, Sunac China Holdings dropped from its peak ranking a year earlier to eighth place.


                            <br><br>
                            2022 has proven to be the most challenging year for real estate developers, with many enduring persistent losses since 2021, resulting in a decline in their wealth.


                            <br><br>
                            "As private business owners, we haven't felt any obvious discrimination," said Wu Yajun, the former executive director of Longfor, in a press conference two months before resigning from the chairman position last year.
                            <br><br>
                            "The regulatory authorities are still very wise and insightful. The direction towards marketization and legalization is still very clear," she added.
                            <br><br>
                            "I don't think state-backed enterprises have an advantage in acquiring land because all land is obtained through public bidding," said Yin, a 50-year-old manager at a state-backed developer in Beijing who wishes not to mention the company’s name.

                                    ​​The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, prompting multinational corporations to reassess their strategies and diversify their supply chains. 


                                    <br><br>

                                    "China will no longer be the country that produced a large quantity of export products in the future," says Chen, this trend is expected to reduce demand for Chinese property, as the country is no longer a major producer of export products. 


                                    <br><br>

                                    As a consequence, China, which used to be a major producer of export products, is expected to see a decline in demand for its property. This shift could lead to inflation, as the cost of manufacturing export products increases.



                                    <br><br>

                                    Governments are under pressure to maintain a high-interest-rate environment to mitigate the impact of inflation and currency depreciation. However, this policy discourages property investment on a global scale. 

                                    <br><br>

                                    Meanwhile, tighter regulations and increased government involvement have also curtailed the recovery of the property market.


                                    <br><br>

                                    Governments are now allocating funds in various sectors, leading to higher government debt-to-GDP ratios, which places a limit on how much interest rates can rise. 


                                    <br><br>

                                    When governments borrow money, they need to pay interest on that borrowed sum, and high-interest rates can make it challenging for them to repay. Consequently, governments must balance their desire to keep interest rates low enough to stimulate the economy with their need to keep rates at a level that enables them to pay their bills without difficulty.




                                    <br><br>

                                    This constraint on interest rate hikes restricts monetary policy tightening, and thus, interest rates are likely to remain low. This policy supports property prices to some extent by making borrowing cheaper. 

                                    <br><br>
                                    However, it also limits the government's capacity to stimulate their economies through interest rate cuts in case of an economic downturn.

                    Real estate firms with substantial sales volume have reported monthly growth in the first quarter of 2023, as per sales data released at the close of March.


                    <br><br>

                    Among the real estate companies with high sales volume, Evergrande's performance stood out with dramatic growth. The company's sales figures surged from $1.5 trillion yuan (234.38 billion) in January to $3.39 trillion yuan (USD 524.3 billion) in March, indicating a staggering growth rate of 436%.

                            Compared with the same period in 2022, Evergrande also recorded the highest growth in March, with a single-month sales volume of $1.02 trillion yuan, up 66.4% compared to last year. China Merchants Shekou's sales contracts in March were $2.209 trillion yuan, a growth of 53.43% from the last same period.


                            <br><br>

                            There were also leading companies that continued to record
                            sales declines this year. In March, Sunac China recorded a
                            nearly 60% year-on-year decline, and veteran real estate
                            company Country Garden also recorded a 17% decline.

                            <br><br>

                            The COVID-19 pandemic in China gradually subsided in the first quarter of 2023, and the buying sentiment in the real estate industry has not shown a "retaliatory" rebound.


                            <br><br>

                            Hang Seng Investment Management's Chief Investment Officer, Wilfred Sit, believes that the most critical factors to consider this year are demand and government policy, and is cautiously optimistic about the real estate industry in 2023.


                            <br><br>
                            "Under the low base effect, the explosive growth this year may not be significant. Measures to encourage consumers to buy back real estate are important …… For example, some coupons that introduced to stimulate such policies that must be used in real estate," Sit said.




                            <br><br>

                           
                             Huang believes returning to pre-pandemic levels this year is "not a big problem," while Li believes it will be impossible to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. He thinks that because the market dropped so severely last year, "it will take time for the market to heat up again, and it will probably take about two years from sales to collection."

                                In 2023, China's real estate industry will continue to face its existing crisis in a high inflation and high-interest-rate environment. Local governments and banking finances will enter the year in a more fragile state.



                                <br><br>

                                At the beginning of the year, the Chinese government introduced policies to rescue the real estate industry, such as lowering purchasing restrictions. However, in the context of continuously rising land costs and consumer confidence still lacking, developers have less room to maneuver.

                                A fundamental principle that the Chinese government has been emphasizing in recent years - 'houses are for living, not for speculation' - coincides with Chen's view that the Chinese real estate industry will eventually face the disappearance of its ultimate demand due to the declining population, as there will be not enough of people to live in them.


                                <br><br>
                                “The property sector probably will no longer be a major driver of Chinese economic growth,” said Chen. 
                                <br><br>
                                As China's real estate industry struggles to maintain its position, other sectors must emerge to keep the big wheel rolling. However, this transition will undoubtedly be challenging.

                    Over the past decade, the mainland China property market has experienced significant growth. In 2011, the Chinese government began to ease restrictions on the property market, allowing for more private investment in the sector. This change in policy led to a surge in property sales, which grew by 27% in 2012 alone.
                    <br>
                    
                    The property market continued to expand over the next several years, with sales increasing by an average of 9% annually between 2013 and 2017. In 2018, however, the Chinese government began to implement new regulations aimed at controlling the growth of the property market. These regulations included stricter lending policies, higher down payment requirements, and limits on the number of properties that individuals could own.
                    <br>
                    
                    Despite these new regulations, property sales in mainland China continued to grow, reaching their peak in 2021. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, property sales in 2021 totaled 18.4 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion), up 20% from the previous year.

                In 2011, Beijing launched a series of policies aimed at
                encouraging private investment in the real estate
                market. The government eased restrictions on developers
                and investors to help support growth in the housing
                sector, which was a significant contributor to the
                country's overall economic growth.
                <br><br>

                One of many changes, it lowered the restrictions on the
                minimum registered capital to RMB 1 million (USD
                150,000) for real estate development companies, making
                it easier for small- and medium-sized developers to
                enter the market. Beforehand, developers were required
                to have a minimum registered capital of RMB 10 million
                (USD 1.5 million).

                        Li, 49, a former worker in the construction
                        sector, said that it was the time for many small
                        developers to start their businesses. “I was in
                        a state-owned company, many colleagues that I
                        knew left for the privately held company at that
                        time, they all got really high paid,” said Li.

                        <br><br>

                        Li soon left the company and became an
                        engineering project supervisor, covering
                        projects from Xiamen, Beijing, Wuhan and
                        Changsha.

                        In 2012, The ensuing surge in property sales
                        increased with a notable 27%, setting the stage
                        for continued expansion in the sector, as sales
                        grew at an average rate of 9% from 2013 to 2017.

                        The policy changes helped to boost the economy,
                        but they also contributed to rising property
                        prices, which led to concerns about the
                        affordability of housing.

                    Over the past decade, the mainland China property
                    market has experienced significant growth. In 2011,
                    the Chinese government began to ease restrictions on
                    the property market, allowing for more private
                    investment in the sector. This change in policy led
                    to a surge in property sales, which grew by 27% in
                    2012 alone.
                    <br>

                    The property market continued to expand over the
                    next several years, with sales increasing by an
                    average of 9% annually between 2013 and 2017. In
                    2018, however, the Chinese government began to
                    implement new regulations aimed at controlling the
                    growth of the property market. These regulations
                    included stricter lending policies, higher down
                    payment requirements, and limits on the number of
                    properties that individuals could own.
                    <br>

                    Despite these new regulations, property sales in
                    mainland China continued to grow, reaching their
                    peak in 2021. According to data from the National
                    Bureau of Statistics, property sales in 2021 totaled
                    18.4 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion), up 20% from the
                    previous year.
